# Weather-Dependent-Hybrid-Energy-Systems
# Abstract
Optimizing and sustaining energy systems is an ongoing global pursuit. Hybrid renewable energy systems have recently emerged as a pioneering approach targeting optimizing resource utilization and reliable energy production. This research aims to reach a method to determine the viability of a given location for the implementation of wind energy and solar power stations. In the analysis, linear algebra concepts will be used to analyze large datasets. . Machine learning, including linear regression, will be performed to utilize the weather statistics for predicting the amounts of energy from the two combined sources. This capability enables the dynamic allocation of solar energy and wind power and then finally optimizes energy production.

# Methodology

The initial phase involves loading meteorological data, manipulating, and exploring them to finally draw meaningful conclusions and analysis. Descriptive statistics are computed to understand the dataset's basic characteristics.

# Correlation Analysis - Leveraging Linear Algebra Principles

To unveil relationships among meteorological parameters, correlation analysis is performed using linear algebra principles. The correlation matrix C is calculated as follows: C_j^i=  (Cov(X_(i ),X_(j )))/(σ(X_i ).σ(X_(j )))
Here, C_(i,j) is the correlation coefficient between variables X_(i ) and X_j, Cov(X_(i ),X_j ) is the covariance between X_(i ) and X_j and σ(X_i ) and σ(X_j)are the standard deviation of  X_(i ) and X_j, respectively. 
The visualization of this matrix through a heatmap provides insights into the linear associations within the meteorological dataset.

# Air Density Computation - Utilizing the Ideal Gas Law

The computation of air density (ρ) as a function of pressure (P) and temperature (T) in Kelvin involves linear algebraic expressions:
ρ= P / (R⋅T) 
Where R is the specific gas constant for dry air (287 J/(kg\c.K)287J/(kg\c.K)). The resulting DataFrame includes the newly computed air density alongside the original pressure and temperature columns. 
Theoretical Power Estimation - A Linear Algebra-Informed Approach

Theoretical power output of a wind turbine is estimated based on wind speed (V), air density (ρ), and turbine specifications. The formula incorporates linear algebraic expressions:
Theoretical Power = 0.5 .cp_coefficient  .π .  〖blade-lenght〗^2  .V^3  .ρ
Adjustments to blade length and the coefficient of performance (cp_coefficient) allow for flexibility in modeling different turbine types.

# Data Transformation and Distribution Analysis - Addressing Linearity

Handling Zero Values:
 Addition of a small constant to mitigate potential issues arising from zero values in theoretical power calculations.
Histogram Visualization:
 Illustration of the distribution of theoretical power through histograms, providing an initial insight into the data spread.
Logarithmic Transformation: 
Application of a logarithmic transformation to the theoretical power values using the expression: Theoretical Power Log = log(1 + Theoretical Power)
This transformation, informed by linear algebra principles, enhances linearity within the data distribution, facilitating a more accurate representation of the theoretical power distribution. See figure (3).

# Multivariate Regression Analysis - Leveraging Linear Algebra in Modeling
	Model Formulation: 
Building a multivariate regression model incorporating the computed air density and the transformed theoretical power. 
	Matrix Representation:
 Utilizing matrix notation to represent the multivariate regression equation as:
Y = Xβ + ε
Where Y is the response vector (Theoretical Power Log), X is the matrix of predictors (including air density), β is the coefficient vector, and ε is the error term.
	Estimation of Coefficients:
 Leveraging linear algebra methods to estimate the coefficients (β) that minimize the sum of squared errors, achieving an optimal fit for the model.
	Train-Test Split:
Train Data=80% of Data
 Test Data=20% of Data
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the linear regression model accurately.
Model Evaluation and Interpretation
	Multivariate Regression Equation:
Y=Xβ+ε
A linear regression model is trained using the training data. The model predicts a certain vector based on multiple meteorological features (X). The evaluation involves calculating the R-squared score for both training and testing sets.
# Assessing Model Performance: 
Evaluation of the regression model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and mean absolute error to gauge its predictive capability.
R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):
R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
In linear algebra terms, R-squared can be expressed using the covariance and variance shown at figure (4).
Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It's calculated as:
MSE=1/n ∑_(i=1)^n▒〖(Y_i`- Y_i)〗^2 
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It's calculated as:
MAE=n1∑i=1n∣y^i−yi∣ 
In linear algebra, this can be expressed as: 
MEA=1/n ∑_(i=1)^n▒〖|Y_i`- Y_i |〗
Interpreting Coefficients: 
Interpretation of the estimated coefficients (β) in the context of the model, highlighting their significance and impact on predicting theoretical power.
